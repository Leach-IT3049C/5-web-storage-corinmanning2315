## How to test the Application:

* Where and how is web storage used?
    The web storage is used locally on the user's computer.
* What are application use cases?
    The user can create a shopping list by entering each item into the form and clicking "enter" or the "Add" button. The entire list can be cleared by clicking the "Clear All" button.

## Technical Write-up of selection of web storage solution:
    Local storage is the best option for this application. The data will not expire. It can be accesed if the browser is refreshed or from another window. If session storage was used, the data would clear when the tab is closed.

## Self Reflection(s):
    I think I did a good job with this. I was able to implement some basic Bootstrap qualities and make the site visually appealing.

## How long it took me/us to finish this:
    A couple of hours
